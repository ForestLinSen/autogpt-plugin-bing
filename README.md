The Auto-GPT Bing Baidu Search Plugin is a useful plugin for the base project, Auto-GPT. With the aim of expand the search experience, this search plugin integrates Bing and Baidu search engines into Auto-GPT, complementing the existing support for Google Search and DuckDuckGo Search provided by the main repository.
